# RefMate

RefMate is a web-based platform that helps you organize and share references used in your videos. With our time-stamped reference linking feature, you can easily link references to specific moments in your videos, making it easy for viewers to find and save them. 🕰️

Our user-friendly interface makes it easy for you to navigate and manage your references. You can even organize them into different categories and tags, so you can find and access them later. 📚

We also have a public library where you can share your references with the community. And with our powerful search functionality, you can find references you've previously linked or shared. 🔎

## Technologies

RefMate is built with the following technologies:

- Node.js for the backend and logic, allowing for lightning-fast performance and scalability.
- MongoDB for storing and managing our reference data, providing a robust and flexible solution.
- AWS for hosting our platform and leveraging its powerful tools for increased efficiency and reliability.
- Apache Kafka for real-time data processing and streamlining communication between services.
- Kubernetes and Docker for containerization and orchestration, ensuring seamless deployment and scaling.
- Jenkins for continuous integration and automated testing, ensuring the highest quality and stability.

We're a community of content creators who want to simplify the referencing process. We're always looking for ways to make RefMate better and more efficient. Join us and let's make referencing fun and easy! 🚀
